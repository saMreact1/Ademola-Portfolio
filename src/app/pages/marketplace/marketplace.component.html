        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            While any business can open a Flutterwave Store and list a product, Flutterwave Marketplace is an exclusive listing for select Flutterwave stores that meet the eligibility criteria. <br>
            After introducing Flutterwave Market, parts of the new dashboard included a flow where Store owners can apply to include their store on Flutterwave Market.
        </p>
        <div>
            <span class="role"><span>Product:</span> Listing a store on Flutterwave Marketplace</span>
            <span class="role"><span>Company:</span> Flutterwave Store & Flutterwave Market</span>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
            <span>1. </span>
            Store owners weren’t sure what all the eligibility criteria were
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>2. </span>
            When a Store Owner got rejected, they weren’t always sure why
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>3. </span>
            They received the same generic piece of rejection.

        <h4>How I approached the problem</h4>
        <p>
            For the first problem, which was not knowing what they needed to be eligible for a listing, I suggested introducing a modal that only just listed all the criteria. <br>
            We needed to make sure that people saw this on their dashboard before proceeding to apply, to reduce the margin of error.
        </p>

        <span class="caption">I suggested a clickable “See criteria” button which when clicked, displays all criteria for listing a store on Flutterwave Market.</span>
        <img src="../../../assets/images/m-approach0.png" alt="">
        <span class="caption">Modal pops up when a user clicks on “See criteria”</span>
        <p class="mt-4">
            For the second problem, to make sure users got specific rejections, I worked with the PM and backend engineer to create individual modals displaying reasons. I got a list of scenarios and created a copy for each modal as displayed below.
